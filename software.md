The required software for this workshop is all free and open source
and will run identically on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

There are a few pieces of software to install:

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/): An environment for statistical
    computing.
-   [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): An integrated development
    environment for using R.
-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): A bundle of R packages to
    use R the modern way.
-   R packages for generalized linear models.

## Installing R

Go to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) website and follow the links
for downloading. On Windows, this should lead you to

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.

Downloading this and following the usual Windows installation process,
you\'ll then have a full working version of R.

On Macs, the installation procedure is essentially identical. The latest
Mac installer should be available at

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>.

Download this and follow the usual Mac installation process to get a
full working version of R for Macs.

## Installing Rstudio

Using Rstudio is not strictly necessary. You can do all you need to do
with R without using Rstudio. However, many people have found that using
R is more convenient and pleasant when working through Rstudio. To
install it, go to the [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website,
specifically to

-   <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

which will list all the available installers. Note that you just want
the Rstudio *desktop* program. The Rstudio *server* is something else
(basically it is for providing remote access to Rstudio hosted on Linux
servers).

Again, you\'ll just follow the usual installation process for Windows or
Macs to install Rstudio using these installers.

## Using RStudio Cloud as an alternative

If you would rather not install R/RStudio on your own machine, or you have difficulty doing so now, you have the option of using RStudio online using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). This is a full featured version on RStudio that runs in a web browser using the RStudio Server technology. The only drawback is that you only get 15 hours per month for free (you get unlimited access if you willing to pay; though it is quite expensive). However, 15 hours is just enough for this 2 day course.

## Installing the tidyverse packages

The so-called [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of
interrelated R packages that implement essentially a new standard
library for R. In other words, the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) gives us a bundle tools for
doing commonplace data manipulation and visualization and programming.
It represents the modern way to use R, and in my opinion, it\'s the best
way to use R. All the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages
can be installed by typing the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The main packages that are contained within the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) bundle are listed
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

## Installing other R packages for generalized linear models

We will be able to do generalized linear models using built-in packages in R, but there are a few other packages that we will need too.
```r
install.packages("pscl")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("ordinal")
install.packages("nnet")
```
